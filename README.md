# CNN_for_NCM-composition-and-state-prediction:
Composition and state prediction of lithium-ion cathode via convolutional neural network trained on scanning electron microscopy images.
The work is being under progress, therefore, we still keep the dataset confidential. Howeever, the dataset can be distributed upon reasonable request.
